# MyCredits Solidity Contract

## Description
The MyCredits Solidity contract is a simple Ethereum smart contract that manages a basic token system. It allows users to mint new tokens, burn existing tokens, and provides information about the total token supply. This contract can be used as a foundation for building more complex token systems or for educational purposes.

## Getting Started
### Executing Program
To deploy and interact with the MyCredits contract, follow the steps below:

1. **Deployment Environment**: Use an Ethereum development environment or an online Solidity IDE like Remix.

2. **Contract Deployment**:
   - Create a new Solidity file and name it `MyCredits.sol`.
   - Copy and paste the provided contract code into the file.
   - Compile the contract using a Solidity compiler compatible with version ^0.8.0.
   - Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network of your choice.

3. **Interacting with the Contract**:
   - Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using its functions:
     - `mint`: Allows users to create new tokens by increasing the total supply and the balance of a specified address.
     - `burn`: Enables users to destroy existing tokens by decreasing the total supply and the balance of a specified address.
