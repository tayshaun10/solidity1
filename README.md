# MyToken Solidity Contract

## Description
This Solidity program defines a basic ERC20 token contract named `MyToken`. The contract includes functionalities for minting new tokens and burning existing tokens. It serves as a simple demonstration of how to create and interact with ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have an Ethereum development environment set up.
- You can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE, or your preferred development environment.

### Installation
1. Copy the provided Solidity code into a new file with a `.sol` extension.
2. Compile the contract using your preferred Solidity compiler, ensuring compatibility with the version specified in the pragma statement (`0.8.18` in this case).
3. Deploy the compiled contract to an Ethereum network, such as a local development network or a testnet.

### Usage
- After deploying the contract, you can interact with it using Ethereum wallets or by calling its functions programmatically.
- The `mint` function allows the contract owner to create new tokens and assign them to a specified address.
- The `burn` function allows token holders to destroy a specified amount of their tokens, reducing the total token supply.
